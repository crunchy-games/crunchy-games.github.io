    We are a collective of 5 idiotic teenagers, as the home page says.
    <br>
    Of course, we love making games (obviously), and we don't touch grass because it's kind of stinky.
    <br>
    Of course, most of us aren't actually programmers. Except for Dom, the guy writing this.
    This isn't even my job, this is NC's, why the hell am I doing this? Anyways, most of us are artistic (and autistic (Dom)).
    I, the writer, love programming in languages that aren't JavaScript (stay mad NC (im not mad)), so I was thrusted into the role.
    <br>
    NC, who I definitely have no disagreements with, is very good with JS and HTML, so he makes the UI and typically creates the websites.
    <br>
    The rest are artists, musicians, etc.
    <br>
    <br>
    I mean... what else do I say?
