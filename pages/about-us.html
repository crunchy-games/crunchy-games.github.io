      We are a collective of 5 idiotic teenagers, as the home page says.
      <br>
      Of course, we love making games (obviously), and we don't touch grass because
      it's kind of stinky.
      <br>
      Of course, most of us aren't actually programmers. Except for the guy writing this.
      This isn't even my job, this is NC's, why the hell am I doing this? Anyways, most of
      us are artistic (and autistic). I, the writer, love programming in languages that aren't
      JavaScript (stay mad NC), so I was thrusted into the role.
      <br>
      NC, who I definitely have no disagreements with, is very good with JS and HTML, so he makes
      the UI and typically creates the websites.
      <br>
      The rest are artists, musicians, etc.
      <br>
      <br>
      I mean... what else do I say?
